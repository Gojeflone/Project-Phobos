                Ryan, Anaya and Dennis are college students and active youth leaders in their church. 
                They believe in loving and empowering all of God's children and giving them a place 
                to call home.

                Unfortunately, the Church has been one of the largest contributors to the violence, 
                mistreatment and disenfranchisment of the LGBTQIA+ community, among others. All too 
                often, so-called Christians spew a few Bible verses that they've had no contextual 
                understanding of, and they cause a great deal of harm to those in the LGBTQIA+ 
                community. Ryan, Anaya and Dennis believe that it is time that the Church begins 
                following Christ, instead of its own prejudice, hate and misinformation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Church has also disenfranchised its "own people" - specifically, the Youth. The Youth 
                are rarely given opportunities to grow in the Church. They are rarely given meaningful 
                responsibilities. They are often ignored, rejected and pushed away. There is a reason that 
                70-75% of Christian youth leave the Church after high school 
                (<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/08/24/why-americas-nones-left-religion-behind/" target="_blank">
                Pew Research Center
                </a>). They 
                are not treated as real, respected, functioning members. And if they don't have a reason 
                to stay, then why stick around?
            </p>
            <p>
                This is why the TABLE was built. 
            </p>
            <p>Ryan, Anaya and Dennis fullheartedly believe that the Youth are respected and loved - 
                regarldess of who they love. The Youth have a home. The Youth are welcomed, encouraged 
                and empowered at the TABLE. We are Youth run and Youth led - meaning we all have a place 
                and a part in this community. There is room for you at the TABLE.

        <div class="col-12 col-lg-8 m-auto text-lg-left">
            <p>The TABLE's core beliefs are Love, Relationship and Accountability.</p>
            <h2>Love:</h2>
            <p>God is love (
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A7-21&version=ESV" target="_blank">
                1 John 4:7-12
                </a>
                ). We are created in the image of God (
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A27&version=NIV" target="_blank">
                Genesis 1:27
                </a>
                ); 
                therefore we were created in the image of Love. All love flows through God, and 
                we must not clog that pipeline. We should love all people, regardless of who they 
                are, where they come from, what they look like, who they love, etc. because that 
                is exactly what Jesus did, does and commands us to do (
                    <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12%3A31&version=NIV" target="_blank">
                Mark 12:31
                </a>
                )!
            </p>
            <h2>Relationship:</h2>
            <p>
                Because we love everyone, that means we love each other too! We need to have a 
                relationship with one another, but not just a friendship. Jesus describes the 
                church as his bride (
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A2%2C9-10&version=KJV;NIV" target="_blank">
                Revelation 21:2
                </a>). We are married to God, and in turn, 
                we all have a relationship with Him - <em>and</em> with one another. We should connect, 
                relation and experience life together and as a family.
            </p>
            <h2>Accountability:</h2>
            <p>
                Because we are a family and we love each other, we must keep each other accountable (
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+5%3A16&version=ESV" target="_blank">James 5:16</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+27%3A17&version=ESV" target="_blank">Proverbs 27:1</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+17%3A3&version=ESV" target="_blank">Luke 17:3</a>). 
                Let us be clear: that does not mean judgment or harassment, for we all have messed up (
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23&version=NIV" target="_blank">Romans 3:23</a>
                ). What we mean is that 
                it is our goal to practice and facilitate loving and authentic accountability (
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+6%3A1-5&version=ESV" target="_blank">Galatians 6:1</a>). 
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is to have a genuine walk with God and to be involved in each other’s lives. If we are successful in our 
                involvement, we are all walking with God <em>together</em>!  What a privilege - and relief!
            </p>
            <p>
                The truth is, sometimes the road gets bumpy. Sometimes we get tired. Sometimes we want to go another way. But we’re here for each 
                other. When one stumbles, we all lift them up (Ecclesiastes 4:9-12). If one is struggling, we carry their cross (
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+6%3A1-5&version=ESV" target="_blank">Galatians 6:2-5</a>). 
                We are what the church was supposed to have been: a place of <b>honesty</b> and <b>vulnerability</b> through <b>authentic relationship</b> with one another.
